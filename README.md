Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Diabetes refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar(glucose).When we eat,our body turns food into sugars,or glucose.At that point, our pancreas is supposed to release insulin.Insulin serves as a key to open our cells,to allow the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose for energy.High blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination,increased thirst,and increased hunger.
